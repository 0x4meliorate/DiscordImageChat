# Discord Image Chat

This script allows you to send text messages in images.  
Which are then uploaded to the Discord chat.  

Just run chat.py with python.  
Type `stego` into the Discord channel.  
Then enter your chat in the terminal.  
Anything you enter, is sent into that channel from now on.
